## HAIL: Human⥈AI Interoperability Layer Framework
[Go to documentation ❲➤❳](HAIL/README.md)

**The Human⥈AI Interoperability Layer (HAIL)** is a governance and alignment framework that makes AI interactions predictable, auditable, and safer for better **User Experiences**. It does this by enforcing structured communication, explicit decision-making, and deterministic behavior across the entire Human–AI workflow. HAIL combines a custom two-stage **Grammar** system with a suplimentry **JSON-based** governance data to control how an AI interprets directives, manages context, handles tools, applies safety rules, and reveals failure modes.

Built from real conversational case studies, HAIL focuses on interaction reliability, context integrity, dissent signaling, ethical execution, and cross-tool consistency. The framework acts as both a UX discipline and an alignment layer—ensuring that human intent is honored, ambiguity is surfaced, and every step is traceable.
